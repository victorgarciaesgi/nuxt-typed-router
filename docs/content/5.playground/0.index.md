# Live example

Unfortunetely, StackBlitz and CodeSandbox still can't support `Volar` IDE extension, so any `.vue` file autocompletion will not work online. 

[The example repo is available here](https://github.com/victorgarciaesgi/nuxt-typed-router-demo)

The only online playground we can show will be on a Typescript file, but it wil be enough to see the magic.

To test `<NuxtLink/>` autocomplete, you will have to open it in your local VSCode

- To test autocomplete on the online IDE, go he `store/testRouter.ts`
- In local env (VSCode), you can edit `pages/index.vue` or any `.vue` file.
- Add/delete pages files to see the magic
