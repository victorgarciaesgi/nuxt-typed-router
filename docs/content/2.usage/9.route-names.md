# Route names dictionnary

When your app is too big, you can start having 50+ routes, navigating the suggestions can not be as intuitive.

A other way of providing the route name is available with `nuxt-typed-router`

A object tree containing a representation of your `pages` folder is accessible everywhere.

```ts

import {routesNames, useRouter} from '@typed-router';

const router = useRouter();

// Instead of doing
router.push({name: 'profile-id-slug'})


// You can do

router.push({name: routesNames.profile.id.slug})
```


::alert{type='info'}
If you activated the `plugin` option, `$routesNames` will also be injected into your global properties
