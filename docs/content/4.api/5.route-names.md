# Route names dictionary

When your app is too big, you can start having 50+ routes, and navigating the suggestions can become less intuitive.

Another way of providing the route name is available with `nuxt-typed-router`.

An object tree containing a representation of your `pages` folder is accessible everywhere:

```ts
import {routesNames, useRouter} from '@typed-router';

const router = useRouter();

// Instead of doing
router.push({name: 'profile-id-slug'})

// You can do
router.push({name: routesNames.profile.id.slug})
```

::note
If you activated the `plugin` option, `$routesNames` will also be injected into your global properties.
